It works perfectly from the command line, but Im looking to build out a desktop frontend…. I was wondering if you had any experience…. It may have a commercial lifecycle…!

>theghostofm · 2 yr. ago I'm not even remotely connected to a GUI in my normal work, but Fyne is one of the libraries that truly excites me. It's very actively updated, the creator is open about planned features (and just a joy to talk to), and it seems to have a great API for what it is. The #fyne channel on the Gophers Slack is a fantastic place to be to watch its progress
