>Run the `go mod init` command, giving it your module path -- here, use `example.com/greetings`. If you publish a module, *this must be a path from which your module can be downloaded by Go tools*. That would be your code's repository.

[Why is GO111MODULE everywhere, and everything about Go Modules (updated with Go 1.17) | maelvls dev blog ](https://maelvls.dev/go111module-everywhere/)
>`go get` has been *deprecated* for installing binaries since Go 1.17 and will be become impossible in Go 1.18. If you are using Go 1.16 or above, you should use instead: `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest`

>When Go was first introduced in 2009, it was not shipped with a package manager. Instead, go get would fetch all the sources by using their import paths and store them in $GOPATH/src. There was no versioning and the ‘master’ branch would represent a stable version of the package.
>Go Modules (previously called vgo – versioned Go) were introduced with Go 1.11. Instead of using the GOPATH for storing a single git checkout of every package, Go Modules stores tagged versions with go.mod keeping track of each package’s version. Since then, the interaction between the ‘GOPATH behavior’ and the ‘Go Modules behavior’ has become one of the biggest gotchas of Go. *One environment variable is responsible for 95% of this pain*: `GO111MODULE`.

Express (NodeJS) is ~1.5x faster than FastAPI (Python) and, these frameworks are ~7.5 and ~11.35 times slower than Fiber (as per multi-core async performance). However, this doesn't mean that you no longer use Python or NodeJS based frameworks. Factors like existing software stack, dev skills & experience in the team will play a significant role in making such decisions. Remember, good Go devs are hard to find compared to Python & JavaScript devs (at the time of writing this article) simply because these languages and their ecosystem have been here for longer.
>If you are starting a new project and you are willing to give GoLang a try. Fiber is a great place to start and, there are many frameworks to choose from.
