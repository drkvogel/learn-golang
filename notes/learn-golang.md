### GOPATH, GOROOT in zsh with oh-my-zsh and Go installed via asdf

>ensure the below are in your shell's rc file.
```
source /usr/local/opt/asdf/asdf.sh

export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```
don't have `/usr/local/opt/asdf/asdf.sh` bc asdf is running as an oh-my-zsh plugin, but as long as `go env` goes after asdf is run, should be OK:
`~/.zshrc`:
```diff
 plugins=(
     git
     asdf
     # zsh-z
     # zsh-syntax-highlighting
 )
 source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

 ...
+export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)
+export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```
